# 🌐 Portfolio Navigation Header

This project implements a clean and modern **navigation header** for a personal or portfolio website using HTML and CSS.  
The header includes a logo, navigation links, and a clear call‑to‑action button, ideal for sections like *Experience*, *Projects*, *About me*, and *Contact*.

## 🎯 Project Overview

The navigation bar sits at the top of the page and provides quick access to key sections of a portfolio.  
It uses a dark gradient background, a circular logo image, and animated hover effects to create a professional and interactive user experience.

## 🧩 Main Features

- **Gradient header background**  
  A linear gradient from light grey to black that gives depth and visual separation.

- **Interactive logo**

  A rounded **Contact** button with hover animations to draw attention.

- **Responsive-friendly layout**
